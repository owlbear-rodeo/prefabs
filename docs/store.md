# Prefabs

Create reusable prefabs out of your most common used items.

## Create a Prefab

To create a prefab select the items you wish to save then click the Create Prefab button in the context menu.

This will open a modal that will allow you to name your new prefab.

Clicking Create will open an Upload modal that will allow you to pick a Collection/Folder to create the prefab in.
A prefab is a standalone Scene that includes just the items in that prefab.

## Insert a Prefab

To insert a prefab you can right click on an empty spot in the canvas then select the Insert Prefab menu item.

If you're on a touch screen device you can tap an empty spot on the canvas and select the three dots to find the Insert Prefab menu item.

## Editing a Prefab

A prefab is a scene. Just like any other scene you can edit the contents of a prefab by opening it and adding tokens, drawings or more. Once you are done editing the prefab the next time you insert it, it will include these changes.
